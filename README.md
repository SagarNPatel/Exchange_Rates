# Exchange_Rates

  -:Foreign Exchange Rates:-
  
  I created a currency converter app. If you travel to foreign countries or do forex trading then you already know 
  the utility of such an application. Even if you do neither of these you'd still find it interesting to check the 
  exchange rates of world currencies and how they vary over time.

  Technology Used:
  HTML,
  CSS,
  JavaScript, 
  jQuery
